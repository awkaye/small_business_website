<div class="about">
<p class="bg">Kae Creaciones began as a simple hobby — experimenting with fuzzy wires and shaping them into small flowers just for fun. What started as a personal creative activity slowly caught the attention of friends and classmates who appreciated the effort and uniqueness of each piece. Because of the positive feedback, the hobby grew into a small handmade business dedicated to sharing creativity and joy. Every flower is carefully shaped, twisted, and arranged by hand, making each creation one-of-a-kind. Through this craft, the business aims to turn ordinary materials into meaningful keepsakes that can brighten someone’s day.</p>
<h2 class="mission">MISSION:</h2>
<p class="themission">Our goal is to provide affordable, cute, and long-lasting floral gifts that people can treasure for years. We want customers to experience the beauty of flowers without worrying about them fading or being thrown away after a few days. Kae Creaciones also aims to promote appreciation for handmade art by showing that simple materials can become memorable gifts when made with effort and care.</p>
